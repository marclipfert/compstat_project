## Description of the Method
The first part of this project is intended to introduce Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its properties. It will be outlined why and how PCA is conducted. Further, special emphasis is put on how to incoporate principal components in a regression (Principal Component Regression, PCR). The theoretical remarks will be followed by a Lab in which empirical features and pitfalls will be illustrated. It will be demonstrated that dimensionality reduction using PCA does not come without a cost. In particular, the predictive performance of PCR may be inferior to that of OLS.

## Empirical Application: The Construction of a Wealth Index
The second part of this project addresses one particular application of PCA in the economic literature. Development economists are often interested in inferring the economic status of a household - either to use it as a control variable or to study the extent of economic inequality. Natural proxies such as data on household income or consumption expenditures are, unfortunately, frequently not elicited in surveys conducted in developing countries. Even if these data are collected, it may not be possible to use them due to extensive reporting errors. Nevertheless, those surveys often include information on asset ownership (e.g. owning a bicycle or a fridge) or variables capturing the materials used for housing construction or regarding the drinking water supply infrastructure. PCA can be employed to combine those variables into a wealth index which proxies for household economic status. Potential pitfalls and weaknesses of this approach will be discussed and illustrated in a simulation study which is part of the second Lab of this project.
